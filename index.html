					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<p>-Front-End Web Development is what I am the absolute best at, however, I am more than capable of handling<br> 
						full-stack responsibilities as well, thanks to my knowledge in back-end web development.<br> 

						-I am very well versed in the following programming languages.<br>
						<ul id="languages">
							 <li>HTML</li>
							 <li>CSS</li>
							 <li>JavaScript</li>
							 <li>Python</li>
							<br>
						</ul>
						However, I am not limited to only those previously listed. Those are simply what I am most fluent and familiar<br> 
						not where my knowledge of program languages caps off at.<br>
					 I am a genuine computer science geek who has a deep passion and fascination with anything computers.<br>
					  I love programming and web development. Therefore, when you have me doing any job involving anything<br>
					   to do with computers or coding, you know you'll have beyond exceptional results produced for you. <br>
					   I am not only passionate, but also a perfectionist when it comes to the quality of my work as well as efficiency. <br>
					   There will be no disappointments in the finished products of any work I do (including finishing projects in an efficient timely manner)
						
						Communication is key and I am not the freelancer who will spare you of any details or keep you<br>
						 in the dark in any way, so long the client desires to be updated verbosely. I pay close attention<br>
						  to detail and I am kind, easy to work with, 100% devoted and dedicated to being the best choice you <br>
						  could have made for looking for the right developer for the job. I will make sure to leave any <br>
						  clients beyond satisfied with any jobs we agree on!</p>
